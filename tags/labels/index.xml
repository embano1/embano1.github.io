      <description>Thanks to Timo Reimann, Bjoern Brundert and Tom Schwaller for their feedback and improving this post.
During a recent customer engagement, a discussion about Kubernetes NodeSelectors came up. There was some confusion about whether and how to use them for a multi-tenant cluster deployment. In the end, we decided to leverage the Kubernetes PodNodeSelector admission controller. Since not all implementation details were clear to me, I did some experiments and wanted to share my findings with you.</description>
