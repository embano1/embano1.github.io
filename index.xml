      <description>Do you know these days, when a certain topic you have thought about a while hits you again and again?
It so happened to me last week, when I first discussed the topic of distributed runtime (read Kubernetes) optimization with Emad Benjamin, Chief Technologist/ Application Platforms at VMware (make sure to follow him on Twitter).

      <description>This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill—the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill—you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember: all I&amp;rsquo;m offering is the truth. Nothing more.

      <description>This post not only is about Kubernetes´ Client-Go SDK Informers, but also marks my first blog post ever. Celebration! Feel free to skip over my sentimental way of saying &amp;ldquo;Thank you&amp;rdquo; in the next paragraph and directly jump into a little bit of research on Client-Go Informers ;)</description>

      <description>&amp;hellip;@bbrundert is the answer (to almost everything btw).
Well, if it wasn´t Björn who finally kicked my &amp;lt;redacted&amp;gt;, I think I´d never started my own blog. I´m pretty active on Twitter (@embano1), and never felt the need to share more than 140 characters with the world.
